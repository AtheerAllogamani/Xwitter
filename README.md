# Xwitter
Xwitter is a social media website created as a PHP learning project. The name is a combination of "X" and the old name "Twitter", as it aims to provide a simpler imitation of the platform.

# How to Get Started
1. Ensure you have XAMPP installed for the database functionality.
2. In the database, locate the "login_db" which contains a single table named "user" with relevant attributes.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Start the Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP.
5. Launch the website and start using Xwitter.

# Future work
When I have more solid foundations, I want to implement the following features and enhancements for Xwitter:
- Default image.
- ~~Implemen multiple tweets~~.
- Add the ability to delete tweets.
- ~~Enable users to view tweets from other users~~.
- Enhance the design for a more visually appealing user interface.
Feel free to contribute to the project by suggesting new features or submitting pull requests. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!
